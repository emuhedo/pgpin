# Pgpin

Pgpin is a toy clone of [Heroku Dataclips](https://dataclips.heroku.com)
created to experiment with app development in Go.

Like Dataclips, the Pgpin app let's you construct SQL queries, view
the results, and share the results with colleagues using a secret
URL.

Pgpin includes an API + workers app (`pgpin-server`), a web
interface (`pgpin-web`), and CLI (`pgpin`).
